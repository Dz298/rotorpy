# RotorPy

RotorPy is a simple dynamics simulator for teaching aerial robotics planning and control and preliminary probing of interesting research questions.

It was developed initially to cater to the University of Pennsylvania aerial robotics class, and so it has unique aspirations.
* Small. Unlike a black box simulator, the engine is intended to be transparent from top to bottom to a student of robotics.
* Easy to install. Dependencies are minimized to ensure easy native installation on Linux, Windows, and Mac.
* Pedagogical. Structure and notation mirror course content, and documentation should be precise.

# License

The package rotorpy itself is released under the MIT License. Contributions of improvements, bug fixes, and documentation are welcome. Course instructors would enjoy hearing if you use rotorpy as a template for other projects.

Please note that rotorpy (and its open source license) does not include course materials such as assignments, solutions, and server integrations.
